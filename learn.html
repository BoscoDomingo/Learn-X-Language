<!-- Here is an example HTML file that we are going to analyse. -->


<!doctype html>
<html>

<head>
    <title>My Site</title>
</head>

<body>
    <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
    <a href="http://codepen.io/anon/pen/xwjLbZ">
        Come look at what this shows
    </a>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
    <p>This is another paragraph.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>This is an item in a non-enumerated list (bullet list)</li>
        <li>This is another item</li>
        <li>And this is the last item on the list</li>

<!--
	An HTML file always starts by indicating to the browser that the page is HTML.
-->
<!doctype html>

<!-- After this, it starts by opening an <html> tag. -->
<html>

<!-- that will be closed at the end of the file with </html>. -->

</html>

<!-- Nothing should appear after this final tag. -->

<!-- Inside (between the opening and closing tags <html></html>), we find: -->

<!-- A header defined by <head> (it must be closed with </head>). -->
<!--
	The header contains some description and additional information which are not
	displayed; this is metadata.
-->

<head>
    <!--
		The tag <title> indicates to the browser the title to show in browser
		window's title bar and tab name.
	-->
    <title>My Site</title>
    <!-- Other attributes can be the favicon, CSS Stylesheets, JS scripts... -->
</head>

<!-- After the <head> section, we find the tag - <body> -->
<!-- Until this point, nothing described will show up in the browser window. -->
<!-- We must fill the body with the content to be displayed. -->

<body>
    <!-- A header, not to be confused with head, can be at the top of
    the page and include several elements, like images, titles, animations... -->
    <header>
        <!-- The h1 tag creates a title. -->
        <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
        <!--
            There are also subtitles to <h1> from the most important (h2) to the most
            precise (h6). You can use them wherever, not just in headers
        -->
    </header>
    <!-- There's also navigation bars, which can be included in the header.
    They can contain any type of element, although usually only links
    are included -->
    <nav>
        <a href="/contact">Contact us</a>
        <a href="/careers">Careers</a>
        <a href="/login">Log in</a>
    </nav>
    <!-- The main content is usually marked with main. Only 1 main element is allowed
    per page -->
    <main>

        <!-- Divs are the most commonly used element, and serve to group elements together
        without further meaning. This is useful to apply specific styles to all children,
        or identify specific elements -->
        <div>
            <!-- The tag <p> lets us include text in the html page. -->
            <p>This is a paragraph.</p>

        </div>


        <!-- The tag <ul> creates a bullet list. -->
        <!--
            To have a numbered list instead we would use <ol> giving 1. for the first
            element, 2. for the second, etc.
        -->
        <ul>
            <li>This is an item in a non-enumerated list (bullet list)</li>
            <li>This is another item</li>
            <li>And this is the last item on the list</li>

        <!-- Footers server to add information at the end of the page -->
        <footer>
            <p align="center">This is a footnote, like: Copyright 2050 - Nevermind it's open source</p>
        </footer>
    </main>
</body>

<!-- And that's it, creating an HTML file can be simple. -->

<!-- But it is possible to add many additional types of HTML tags. -->

<!-- You can add ordered/numbered lists -->

<ol>
    <li>This is an ordered item</li>
    <li>This is another ordered item</li>
</ol>

<!-- The <img /> tag is used to insert an image. -->
<!--
	The source of the image is indicated using the attribute src=""
	The source can be an URL or even path to a file on your computer.
-->
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/XWG0O.gif" />

<!-- It is also possible to create a table. -->

<!-- We open a <table> element. -->
<table>

    <!-- <tr> allows us to create a row. -->
    <tr>

        <!-- <th> allows us to give a title to a table column. -->
        <th>First Header</th>
        <th colspan="2">Second Header occupying 2 cells</th>
    </tr>

    <tr>

        <!-- <td> allows us to create a table cell. -->
        <td>first row, first column</td>
        <td rowspan="4">first row, second column, occupying 4 rows</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>second row, first column</td>
        <td>second row, second column</td>
    </tr>
</table>

    character references with `&` and `;` -->
